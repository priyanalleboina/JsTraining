class:is a behaviour and blue print of objects and can write methods and members

it is like object prototype

instace we have to create and we can access class

static:used to create single tone Object

class Add(){
constructor(a,b){
this.a =a;
this.b =b;

}

describe () {
resturn "result"+ this.a +this.b;
}

const a1 = new Add(2,3);
a. Add(); instace with class

method invoking with class 

and inheritance

using extends keywork we can access class
only single class
ussing super keyword we are calling method
